# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) programming challenges!

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions for the daily puzzles from Advent of Code 2025. Each day's challenge is organized into its own directory, containing the solution code, test files, and any input files.

The primary language used for these solutions is Python.

## Structure

The repository is structured by day:

- `/day1`: Solution for Day 1.
- `/day2`: Solution for Day 2.
- ...and so on.

### Template

Template for challenges can be found in `dayN-template`.

## License

## TODOs

- `day2/test_solution1.py`: Check how to dinamically load test cases from `test_input.txt` instead.
- For log file, use 'test_' + 'file name w/o extension' + '.log'
